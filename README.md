# Introduction 
This project examines the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks and Capsule Networks in the problem domain of classifying exoplanet candidates using light fluctuation readings from NASA telescope data. NASA telescopes record light intensity readings from observed stars, if a planet is orbiting one of these stars on the same visual plane as the telescope, an identifiable dip in light intensity is created. This type of reading is known as a transit event and can take different forms depending on the number and size of planets orbiting a particular star. This method of detection makes up 76.82% of the 5,030 exoplanets discovered.
